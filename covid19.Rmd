This report is created based on a publicly available data. The data are available on a Google Sheet. Please see the Data Source section for link. 
Please note that publicly available data are __not official__ and __MAY BE UNRELIABLE__. I personally did not verify them. I am using them for educational purposes. Use at your discretion.

## Epidemic curve and search for peak

The epidemic curve for Bangladesh and a tentative peak. The red line in the plot indicates a potential peak based on available data. IF the peak (red line) is at the far right, then we may not have reached a peak yet. We must have sustained decrease of incidences to be sure about any peak. 


```{r, covid19-bangladesh-epidemic-curve-peak, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# BD unofficial cases
date_cut_off = ymd("2020-05-10")
date_data_refreshed = max(bd_unoff$date)

bd_unoff_cases <- bd_unoff %>%
  mutate(
    country = "Bangladesh(unoff)"
    , date = as.Date(date, "%d/%m/%Y")
    , daily_cases = c(0, diff(cum_cases))
  ) %>%
  # filter(date <= date_cut_off) %>%
  select(date, country, cum_cases, daily_cases)
bd_incidence_object <- bd_unoff_cases %>% uncount(daily_cases)
# Crate incidence object using incidence package
bd_incidence_object <- incidence::incidence(bd_incidence_object$date)
# Finding peak
bd_incidence_peak <- incidence::find_peak(bd_incidence_object)
plot(bd_incidence_object) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = bd_incidence_peak, col = "red", 
             lty = 2, size=1) +  
  labs(title = "Daily unofficial new infections in Bangladesh ", 
       subtitle = "(Red dashed line indicates date of peak infections)") + theme(text = element_text(size = 12))
```


We fit a log linear model to estimate the doubling time (growh phase) and halving time (decline phase, when that happens). The estimated fitted line (solid line) with 95\% confidence interval (dotten lines) are superimposed on the epidemic curve below.


```{r, covid19-bangladesh-epidemic-curve-fitted, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Fitting the log-linear models to the growth section and the decay section
# bd_incidence_fit <- incidence::fit(bd_incidence_object, split = bd_incidence_peak)
bd_incidence_fit <- incidence::fit(bd_incidence_object)
# plot the incidence data and the model fit
plot(bd_incidence_object) %>% add_incidence_fit(bd_incidence_fit) + 
  labs(title = "Observed and fitted incidence of COVID-19", 
       subtitle = "Bangladesh, 2020") + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12))
```

The current doubling time as of `r today()` is `r round(get_info(bd_incidence_fit, "doubling"), 1)` days with a 95% confidence interval of (`r round(get_info(bd_incidence_fit, "doubling.conf"), 1)`) days. 

### Estimating the Overall Reproduction Number 

The log-linear model estimates the $R_0$ as follows:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Getting the R0 from log-linear model ----

library(distcrete)
library(epitrix)

mu <- 7.5  # days
sigma <- 3.4  # days
param <- gamma_mucv2shapescale(mu, sigma/mu)

w <- distcrete("gamma", interval = 1, shape = param$shape, scale = param$scale, w = 0)

# growth_R0 <- lm2R0_sample(bd_incidence_fit$before$model, w)
growth_R0 <- lm2R0_sample(bd_incidence_fit$model, w)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

hist(growth_R0, col = "grey", border = "white", main = "Distribution of R0")
summary(growth_R0)

```


### Estimating the Instantaneous Reproduction Number ($R_e$)

The estimation of effective reproduction number involves the distribution of serial interval (SI). Based on the literature (REF to be added), a gamma distribution with mean 7.5 and standard deviation 3.5

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(EpiEstim)

# custom results plotting function to avoid the ugly
# TableGrob messages returned by the plotting function in the
# EpiEstim package
plot_Ri <- function(estimate_R_obj) {
  p_I <- plot(estimate_R_obj, "incid", add_imported_cases = TRUE)  # plots the incidence
  p_SI <- plot(estimate_R_obj, "SI")  # plots the serial interval distribution
  p_Ri <- plot(estimate_R_obj, "R")
  return(gridExtra::grid.arrange(p_I, p_SI, p_Ri, ncol = 2))
}

bd_confirmed_cases <- bd_unoff_cases %>%
  mutate(
    daily_cases = c(0, diff(cum_cases))
  )
  
  
bd_res_parametric_si <- 
  estimate_R(bd_confirmed_cases$daily_cases, 
             method = "parametric_si", 
             config = make_config(list(mean_si = 7.5, std_si = 3.5))
)

plot_Ri(bd_res_parametric_si)
```


### Simulating the $R_e$

Now we perform a simulation of different SI distribution to obtain the $R_e$. For this, we vary the parameters of gamma distribution and obtain the following.


```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Recalculating with varying SI distribution parameters 
# we get these results:

config = make_config(list(mean_si = 7.5, std_mean_si = 3, 
                                       min_mean_si = 2, max_mean_si =10.0,
                                       std_si = 3.5, std_std_si = 1,
                                       min_std_si = 0.5, max_std_si = 4))
bd_res_uncertain_si <- 
  estimate_R(bd_confirmed_cases$daily_cases, method = "uncertain_si", 
             config = config)

plot_Ri(bd_res_uncertain_si)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# print the last 7 days of data
bd_res_uncertain_si$R %>%
  tail(7) %>%
  select(t_start, t_end, `Mean(R)`, `Std(R)`,  `Quantile.0.025(R)`, `Quantile.0.975(R)`) %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption=paste("Instantaneous Effective Reproduction Number by Week as of ", date_data_refreshed)) %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center")

R_CI = tail(bd_res_uncertain_si$R, 1)
R_mean = round(as.numeric(R_CI["Mean(R)"]), 2)
R_LCI = round(as.numeric(R_CI["Quantile.0.025(R)"]), 2)
R_UCI = round(as.numeric(R_CI["Quantile.0.975(R)"]), 2)
```

The effective reproduction number based on the last week's incidences show an average of `r R_mean` with a 95\% confidence interval (`r R_LCI`, `r R_UCI`).

- Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis. https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30243-7

  Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged <60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.

> All patients who are hospitalized and need oxygen will be able to sign up for the trial.

> “It’s a flip of a coin – two-thirds of patients will get the antibody-rich blood, with the other third being a control group,” Dr. Arnold said. The control group would receive standard care.

> The trial could be completed in as little as three months. Dr. Arnold said they are realistically looking at six to 10 months before they have definitive results.

> “The challenge is to get to an answer as quickly as possible so that we can start using this product if it’s truly effective, or realize it’s not and stop using it,” Dr. Arnold said.
