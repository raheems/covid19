The data are available on a Google Sheet. Please see the Data Source section for link. Please note that publicly available data are not official and MAY BE UNRELIABLE. I personally did not verify them. I am using them for educational purposes. Use at your discretion. 3.1 Epidemic curve and search for peak The epidemic curve for Bangladesh and a tentative peak. The red line in the plot indicates a potential peak based on available data. IF the peak (red line) is at the far right, then we may not have reached a peak yet. We must have sustained decrease of incidences to be sure about any peak. We fit a log linear model to estimate the doubling time (growh phase) and halving time (decline phase, when that happens). The estimated fitted line (solid line) with 95% confidence interval (dotten lines) are superimposed on the epidemic curve below. The current doubling time as of 2020-05-11 is 5.4 days with a 95% confidence interval of (4.9, 6.1) days. 3.1.1 Estimating the Overall Reproduction Number The log-linear model estimates the \\(R_0\\) as follows: ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 2.067 2.187 2.240 2.246 2.298 2.547 3.1.2 Estimating the Instantaneous Reproduction Number (\\(R_e\\)) The estimation of effective reproduction number involves the distribution of serial interval (SI). Based on the literature (REF to be added), a gamma distribution with mean 7.5 and standard deviation 3.5 3.1.3 Simulating the \\(R_e\\) Now we perform a simulation of different SI distribution to obtain the \\(R_e\\). For this, we vary the parameters of gamma distribution and obtain the following. # Recalculating with varying SI distribution parameters # we get these results: config = make_config(list(mean_si = 7.5, std_mean_si = 3, min_mean_si = 2, max_mean_si =10.0, std_si = 3.5, std_std_si = 1, min_std_si = 0.5, max_std_si = 4)) bd_res_uncertain_si &lt;- estimate_R(bd_confirmed_cases$daily_cases, method = &quot;uncertain_si&quot;, config = config) plot_Ri(bd_res_uncertain_si) Table 3.1: Instantaneous Effective Reproduction Number by Week as of 2020-05-10 t_start t_end Mean(R) Std(R) Quantile.0.025(R) Quantile.0.975(R) 52 53 59 1.381095 0.1220391 1.140688 1.580954 53 54 60 1.362686 0.1250910 1.119230 1.565571 54 55 61 1.340627 0.1252016 1.105575 1.547362 55 56 62 1.316938 0.1222243 1.094182 1.522803 56 57 63 1.279930 0.1152924 1.077195 1.479673 57 58 64 1.280380 0.1088512 1.094498 1.473715 58 59 65 1.309349 0.1047752 1.127540 1.497728 The effective reproduction number based on the last weekâ€™s incidences show an average of 1.31 with a 95% confidence interval (1.13, 1.5). 3.1.4 Cumulative Deaths (official and unofficial) Table 3.2: Total number of deaths as of 2020-05-11 country Total Deaths Bangladesh(unoff) 446 Bangladesh 228 3.2 Bangladesh in South Asia 3.2.1 Infection Table 3.3: Total number of cases as of 2020-05-10 country Total Cases India 67161 Pakistan 30334 Singapore 23336 Bangladesh(unoff) 15691 Bangladesh 14657 Indonesia 14032 Malaysia 6656 Sri Lanka 863 Nepal 110 Bhutan 7 3.2.2 Deaths Table 3.4: Total number of deaths as of 2020-05-10 country Total Deaths India 2212 Indonesia 973 Pakistan 659 Bangladesh(unoff) 446 Bangladesh 228 Malaysia 108 Singapore 20 Sri Lanka 9 Bhutan 0 Nepal 0 3.2.3 Cases and deaths compared on a specific day Bangladesh has entered into day 64 since first confirmed case.
