An upward trend may indicate more recovery than deaths. 1.5.1 Recovery-to-death ratio (South and South-East Asia) 1.5.2 Recovery-to-death ratio (Middle East) 1.6 3-day % changes The percent change is calculated as \\[ PC = \\frac{New - Original}{Original} * 100 \\] where New is the number of cases on a given date, and Original is the number 3 days prior to that. How to interpret: The 3-day percent change tells how much does a metric have changed (%) compared to what it was 3-days ago. A downward trending line suggests a slow growth. References "]
