An upward trend may indicate more recovery than deaths. 1.5.1 Recovery-to-death ratio (South and South-East Asia) 1.5.2 Recovery-to-death ratio (Middle East) 1.6 3-day % changes The percent change is calculated as \\[ PC = \\frac{New - Original}{Original} * 100 \\] where New is the number of cases on a given date, and Original is the number 3 days prior to that. How to interpret: The 3-day percent change tells how much does a metric have changed (%) compared to what it was 3-days ago. A downward trending line suggests a slow growth. References "],

Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis. https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30243-7 Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.

["stories.html", "Report 5 Stories 5.1 Rumi Ahmed", " Report 5 Stories Report last updated: 2020-04-15 5.1 Rumi Ahmed 5.1.1 April 7, 2020 (via Facebook) I lived through the swine flu (2009 H1N1) pandemic which infected 60 million (1 in 6 American) and killed about 12000 Americans. Global death toll was around 300000. Then we lived through Bird Flu (50% mortality), Ebola (70% mortality), MERS(40% mortality), Zika (airborne and. It this defect) scare and cattle call. So when COVID-19 started ravaging Wuhan, China and Lombardy, Italy - me and many of my frontline, more informed physician colleague were like the mythical shepherd boys. We Have been dismissive! Dismissive because, with R0 of 2.5-2.9, SARS-COV-2 was less contagious than SARS-1 of 2002 and definitely much less fatal than SARS-1, MERS, Bird Flu, Ebola etc. We knew that SARS-1, MERS, Avian influenza blazed for a few months in a few localities then stoped abruptly. R0 became &lt;1, the epidemic died down. And SARS-COV-2 was a petty coronavirus! It was a mere coronavirus!! It was not the feared shifted- drifted influenza virus causing Flu pandemic we have been fearing half of the last century. Despite SARS -1 and MERS experience - we didn’t give this bat coronavirus due respects it deserved. It was not the feared white walker, it was not the novel influenza pandemic we always have been fearful about. But this novel coronavirus SARA-COV-2 turned out to be the cause of first coronavirus pandemic, to be more precise , the first non-influenza pandemic in history of mankind. So what went wrong with this Novel coronavirus? Biologically less contagious and less fatal than SARS-1, instead of behaving like SARS-1 or MERS, why this novel coronavirus is blazing like a catastrophic forest fire? The answer is in one protein. Remember this name. It’s a protein called Exonuclease. Exonuclease! We are still inside the deep fog of war, at the center of a bloody- muddy battle field, we are wielding swords blindly! We don’t have the clarity of a bird eye view or the luxury of a time lapse retrospect! Hazy view through early data says the following about this new enemy - this virus- It is a bat virus, and thorough perpetual mixing and mutation inside the bat reservoir, this bat virus mutated and developed as a new virus sometimes between 1948 and 1972. Chinese horseshoe bats are carrying this virus for the last several decades! Like tornado chasers - there are a group of scientists knows as virus chasers who are skimming wild bat habitants in search of viruses that they call pre-pandemic viruses. They are isolating bat viruses which in the future has the potential to transmit to human and cause a new pandemic. They are pre-preparing for the next pandemic by sequencing them and trying to see vaccine potential. This new SARS-COV-2 was not in that pre-pandemic bat virus database. In fact this virus was never known to us despite it was circulating inside horseshoe bats for the last several decades. It says that our limited search efforts with lackluster funding was not enough to capture many bat viruses. This horseshoe Chinese cave bats are not fruit bats- they have teeth and may infect human / other animals by any close contact. Somehow humans got this SARS-COV-2 bat virus and stated getting sick. Did this jump ( virus changing host from bat to human) happen last fall? Did similar COVID-19 disease clusters happen before 2019 but we didn’t notice? Very possible. Remember AIDS. We always thought that HIV virus came to Human from Chimpanzee in 1983. But we now know that the jump probably happened in 1929! Since 1929, there have been undetected local epidemics AIDS. So SARS-COV-2 virus found this new host in human species which is abundant in planet earth. This virus, in this new host, has only one job in life- propagate! Remember the evolutionary theory of selection. This virus came this far- and so far winning against the most powerful species ever lived in this planet, Homo sapiens - this virus is the fittest. Genetically and biochemically, this virus is the chosen one, the selected one to survive and propagate. Millions / billions of other weaker viral species got defeated / lost out - this one didn’t! This is pure simple theory of selection! Why this virus has been selected to come this far and win over a complex new host? There are many factors and explanations! But one factor is that it has a protein called Exonuclease in its arsenal! Exonuclease is a protein this virus generates for a job called genetic proof-reading! Viruses are constantly replicating into new viruses. That’s how they propagate. Usually viral spreads die down after an initially blaze because the progeny keeps getting weaker and weaker due to constant mutations. Usually viruses don’t have a quality control officer in its payroll! But this virus has a powerful quality control officer. This Exonuclease protein is ensuring that every single progeny this virus is producing is a healthy progeny. It’s not allowing heavily mutated viruses which usually terminated the chain of transmission. And because of this Exonuclease, unlike SARS-1, MERS, this virus is not suddenly disappearing from the horizon; rather with Alexander the Great vigor, this virus is marching - conquering country after country, sacking city after city!

The control group would receive standard care. The trial could be completed in as little as three months. Dr. Arnold said they are realistically looking at six to 10 months before they have definitive results. “The challenge is to get to an answer as quickly as possible so that we can start using this product if it’s truly effective, or realize it’s not and stop using it,” Dr. Arnold said.
