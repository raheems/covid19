The data are available on a Google Sheet. Please see the Data Source section for link. Please note that publicly available data are not official and MAY BE UNRELIABLE. I personally did not verify them. I am using them for educational purposes. Use at your discretion. 3.1 Epidemic curve and search for peak The epidemic curve for Bangladesh and a tentative peak. The red line in the plot indicates a potential peak based on available data. IF the peak (red line) is at the far right, then we may not have reached a peak yet. We must have sustained decrease of incidences to be sure about any peak. We fit a log linear model to estimate the doubling time (growh phase) and halving time (decline phase, when that happens). The estimated fitted line (solid line) with 95% confidence interval (dotten lines) are superimposed on the epidemic curve below. The current doubling time as of 2020-05-28 is 6.7 days with a 95% confidence interval of (6.2, 7.4) days. 3.1.1 Estimating the Overall Reproduction Number The log-linear model estimates the \\(R_0\\) as follows: ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 1.729 1.909 1.937 1.940 1.976 2.110 3.1.2 Estimating the Instantaneous Reproduction Number (\\(R_e\\)) The estimation of effective reproduction number involves the distribution of serial interval (SI). Based on the literature (REF to be added), a gamma distribution with mean 7.5 and standard deviation 3.5 3.1.3 Simulating the \\(R_e\\) Now we perform a simulation of different SI distribution to obtain the \\(R_e\\). For this, we vary the parameters of gamma distribution and obtain the following. # Recalculating with varying SI distribution parameters # we get these results: config = make_config(list(mean_si = 7.5, std_mean_si = 3, min_mean_si = 2, max_mean_si =10.0, std_si = 3.5, std_std_si = 1, min_std_si = 0.5, max_std_si = 4)) bd_res_uncertain_si &lt;- estimate_R(bd_confirmed_cases$daily_cases, method = &quot;uncertain_si&quot;, config = config) plot_Ri(bd_res_uncertain_si) Table 3.1: Instantaneous Effective Reproduction Number by Week as of 2020-05-29 t_start t_end Mean(R) Std(R) Quantile.0.025(R) Quantile.0.975(R) 69 70 76 1.448038 0.1526428 1.151118 1.698255 70 71 77 1.498403 0.1598228 1.188143 1.760887 71 72 78 1.449266 0.1594346 1.131820 1.707544 72 73 79 1.415244 0.1571004 1.113479 1.670823 73 74 80 1.329581 0.1451441 1.061438 1.568684 74 75 81 1.253629 0.1288177 1.033887 1.475302 75 76 82 1.222198 0.1125257 1.045840 1.426537 The effective reproduction number based on the last weekâ€™s incidences show an average of 1.22 with a 95% confidence interval (1.05, 1.43). 3.1.4 Cumulative Deaths (official and unofficial) Table 3.2: Total number of deaths as of 2020-05-28 country Total Deaths Bangladesh(unoff) 547 Bangladesh 544 3.2 Bangladesh in South Asia 3.2.1 Infection Table 3.3: Total number of cases as of 2020-05-27 country Total Cases India 158086 Pakistan 59151 Bangladesh(unoff) 40321 Bangladesh 38292 Singapore 32876 Indonesia 23851 Malaysia 7619 Sri Lanka 1469 Nepal 886 Bhutan 28 3.2.2 Deaths Table 3.4: Total number of deaths as of 2020-05-27 country Total Deaths India 4534 Indonesia 1473 Pakistan 1225 Bangladesh(unoff) 547 Bangladesh 544 Malaysia 115 Singapore 23 Sri Lanka 10 Nepal 4 Bhutan 0 3.2.3 Cases and deaths compared on a specific day Bangladesh has entered into day 81 since first confirmed case.
