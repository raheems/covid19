An upward trend may indicate more recovery than deaths. 1.3.1 Recovery-to-death ratio (including China) 1.3.2 Recovery-to-death ratio (South Asia) 1.3.3 Recovery-to-death ratio (Middle East) 1.4 3-day % changes The percent change is calculated as \\[ PC = \\frac{New - Original}{Original} * 100 \\] where New is the number of cases on a given date, and Original is the number 3 days prior to that. How to interpret: The 3-day percent change tells how much does a metric have changed (%) compared to what it was 3-days ago. A downward trending line suggests a slow growth. "],

Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis. https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30243-7 Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.
