Please scroll down to find the projections. As usual, the last two current values were not used for fitting the model. Also, the model is conservative/pessimistic i.e., it slightly overestimates new cases. In addition to that, a new paramter to control the run_date was added to the fit_seir() function. See the code for more details. 4.1 Projection for Bangladesh (unofficial) Run1 Run date: 17 April 2020 This is a dynamic document and will be updated frequently. Please check back for latest projection. This projection is based on unofficial Bangladesh incidence data. 4.1.1 Methodology This projection is based on an SEIR model. Here, the S stands for Susceptible, E stands for Exposed/infected but asymptomatic, I stands for Infected and symptomatic, and R stands for Recovered. N is the population size. Assuming there is no births or deaths in a population, (known as a closed population), the model is formulated by the following differential equations. \\[ \\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial t} &amp; = -\\frac{\\beta I S}{N} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t} &amp;= \\frac{\\beta I S}{N} -\\sigma E \\\\ \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial t} &amp;= \\sigma E - \\gamma I \\\\ \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial t} &amp;= \\gamma I \\end{align} \\] Here the parameters \\(\\beta\\) controls the transmission rate, which is the product of contact rate and the probability of transmission given contact betwen S and E compartments. \\(\\sigma\\) controls the transition from E to I, and \\(\\gamma\\) controls the transition from I to R. The reproduction rate, \\(R_0\\) can be approximated by \\[R_0 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}\\] In plain language, \\(R_0\\) tells us how many people are infected from one patient. An \\(R_0&gt;1\\) indicates the epidemic is at the grotwh phase. \\(R_0&lt;1\\) means the epidemic is slowing or decaying. Model was fitted using all but the last two dayâ€™s incidences to obtain the estimated \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\). The fitted model was used for prediction. This post was inspired by Churches (2020), where you will find some details on the computation. 4.1.2 Ascertainment Rate Not all the cases are reported or tested. Usually a fraction of the actual cases are detected. This is known as ascertainment rate. We consider 25%, 50%, 75% amd 90% ascertainment rate when fitting the model. Simply, the incidences are inflated by the inverse of the ascertainment rate. Please let me know if you find any error in it. The code was adapted from Churches (2020) library(deSolve) library(grid) library(gridExtra) ###################################### ## SIER Modeling ------- ###################################### # Parameters # beta = rate of expusore from susceptible infected contact # sigma = rate at which exposed person becomes infected # gamma = rate at which infected person recovers # S = Initial susceptible population # E = Initial exposed population # I = Initial infected population # R = Recovered population fit_seir &lt;- function(country_name=&#39;Bangladesh(unoff)&#39;, N=170000000, af=0.5, npast=2, nfuture=5, run_date = today()){ # country = Country name # N = population size of the country # af = ascertainment factor, default = 0.5 # country = &quot;Bangladesh(unoff)&quot; # npast = number of days in the past to exclude when fitting the model # default is npast = 2 # nfuture = number of days in the future the algorithm to predict to # default is nfuture=5 # run_date = sets the cutoff date so that the later runs do not overrite # previous runs.

So lets put that figure on a bigger canvas. 4.1.3 Projection for the next 5 days Table 4.1: Predicted new cases for the next 5 days Date Actual daily cases Projected daily cases Actual cumulative cases Projected cumulative cases 36 2020-04-12 139 142 621 840 37 2020-04-13 182 172 803 1012 38 2020-04-14 209 206 1012 1218 39 2020-04-15 219 248 1231 1466 40 2020-04-16 341 298 1572 1764 41 2020-04-17 266 359 1838 2123 42 2020-04-18 NA 433 NA 2556 43 2020-04-19 NA 521 NA 3077 44 2020-04-20 NA 626 NA 3703 45 2020-04-21 NA 754 NA 4457 4.1.4 Projection for 100 days into the future Assuming the situation will remain like this including the interventions currently in place, the 100 day projection suggests that the the peak of the epidemic will be around the middle of June. The trajectory also suggests that the epidemic will end by end of July or early August. 4.2 Projection for Bangladesh (unofficial) Run 2 Run date: 21 April 2020 This is the second projection. For the initial project, please scroll up. The methodology is discussed above. It turns out that the bottom right one fits the current data best. So lets put that figure on a bigger canvas. Please note that in Run 1, we used a similar \\(R_0\\) but a lower ascertainment rate. This time, a higher ascertainment rate is associated with a similar \\(R_0\\). 4.2.1 Projection for the next 5 days Table 4.2: Predicted new cases for the next 5 days Date Actual daily cases Projected daily cases Actual cumulative cases Projected cumulative cases 38 2020-04-14 209 190 1012 1132 39 2020-04-15 219 228 1231 1360 40 2020-04-16 341 274 1572 1634 41 2020-04-17 266 329 1838 1963 42 2020-04-18 306 396 2144 2359 43 2020-04-19 312 475 2456 2834 44 2020-04-20 492 571 2948 3405 45 2020-04-21 434 686 3382 4091 46 2020-04-22 NA 825 NA 4916 47 2020-04-23 NA 990 NA 5906 48 2020-04-24 NA 1190 NA 7096 49 2020-04-25 NA 1429 NA 8525 4.2.2 Projection for 100 days into the future Assuming the situation will remain like this including the interventions currently in place, the 100 day projection suggests that the the peak of the epidemic will be around the middle of June.
