The data are available on a Google Sheet. Please see the Data Source section for link. Please note that publicly available data are not official and MAY BE UNRELIABLE. I personally did not verify them. I am using them for educational purposes. Use at your discretion. 3.1 Epidemic curve and search for peak The epidemic curve for Bangladesh and a tentative peak. The red line in the plot indicates a potential peak based on available data. IF the peak (red line) is at the far right, then we may not have reached a peak yet. We must have sustained decrease of incidences to be sure about any peak. We fit a log linear model to estimate the doubling time (growh phase) and halving time (decline phase, when that happens). The estimated fitted line (solid line) with 95% confidence interval (dotten lines) are superimposed on the epidemic curve below. The current doubling time as of 2020-05-03 is 4.8 days with a 95% confidence interval of (4.3, 5.5) days. 3.1.1 Cumulative deaths (official and unofficial) Table 3.1: Total number of deaths as of 2020-05-03 country Total Deaths Bangladesh(unoff) 395 Bangladesh 175 3.2 Bangladesh in South Asia 3.2.1 Infection Table 3.2: Total number of cases as of 2020-05-02 country Total Cases India 39699 Pakistan 19103 Singapore 17548 Indonesia 10843 Bangladesh(unoff) 9455 Bangladesh 8790 Malaysia 6176 Sri Lanka 705 Nepal 59 Bhutan 7 3.2.2 Deaths Table 3.3: Total number of deaths as of 2020-05-02 country Total Deaths India 1323 Indonesia 831 Pakistan 440 Bangladesh(unoff) 395 Bangladesh 175 Malaysia 103 Singapore 17 Sri Lanka 7 Bhutan 0 Nepal 0 3.2.3 Cases and deaths compared on a specific day Bangladesh has entered into day 56 since first confirmed case.
